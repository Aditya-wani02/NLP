# Introduction to NLP
Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a field of artificial intelligence that focuses on the interaction between computers and human language. It involves understanding, interpreting, and generating human language in a way that computers can comprehend.

To get started with NLP, it's essential to have a basic understanding of topics such as text preprocessing, text classification, named entity recognition, sentiment analysis, machine translation, and more. The projects and resources provided in this repository will help you gain hands-on experience with these concepts.




## Text Preprocessing
Text preprocessing is a crucial step in most NLP projects. It involves transforming raw text data into a format that can be easily understood and analyzed by machine learning models. By applying various preprocessing techniques, you can clean the text, remove noise, standardize the format, and extract useful features that enhance the performance of NLP models.

Here are some common text preprocessing techniques:

### 1. Tokenization
Tokenization breaks down a text into smaller units, usually words or subwords, called tokens. This process simplifies the text by segmenting it into meaningful components, enabling further analysis. Tokenization can be performed using simple techniques like splitting the text on whitespace or more advanced techniques like using language-specific rules or pre-trained tokenizers.

### 2. Case Normalization
Case normalization involves converting all characters in the text to lowercase or uppercase. It helps in avoiding duplicate representations of the same word due to different capitalization and makes the text more consistent.

### 3. Punctuation and Special Character Removal
Removing punctuation marks and special characters is often done to eliminate noise from the text data. Punctuation and special characters usually do not carry significant semantic meaning and can be safely removed.

### 4. Stop Word Removal
Stop words are common words (e.g., "a," "an," "the") that do not carry much meaning in the context of analysis. Removing stop words can reduce noise and the number of features, especially when working with methods like bag-of-words or TF-IDF.

### 5. Lemmatization and Stemming
Lemmatization and stemming are techniques used to reduce words to their base or root forms. Lemmatization converts words to their dictionary or base form (lemma), while stemming truncates words to their root form using heuristics. These techniques help to consolidate similar word variations and improve feature representation.

### 6. Spell Correction
Spell correction is the process of correcting misspelled words in the text. This can be achieved by leveraging language models or dictionaries to suggest and replace incorrect words with their most probable correct counterparts.

### 7. Removing HTML Tags or Special Formatting
When dealing with text data from web sources, it is common to encounter HTML tags or special formatting. Removing these tags or formatting ensures that the text is clean and ready for further analysis.

These preprocessing techniques are often combined and customized based on the specific requirements of your NLP project. It's important to consider the characteristics of your data and the goals of your analysis to determine which preprocessing steps are most appropriate.

By applying effective text preprocessing techniques, you can improve the quality of your data and enable more accurate and meaningful analysis in NLP projects.



## Feature Extraction 


This repository provides an implementation of text extraction techniques in NLP (Natural Language Processing) using Python. The goal is to extract meaningful information and patterns from unstructured text data. The following techniques are covered in this repository:

### 1. One-Hot Encoding
One-Hot Encoding is a technique used to represent categorical data, such as words or tokens, as binary vectors. Each word is represented as a vector where all elements are zero, except for the index corresponding to the word, which is set to one. This technique is useful for converting text data into a numerical representation suitable for machine learning algorithms.

### 2. Bag of Words (BoW)
The Bag of Words model represents text data as a collection of unique words, disregarding grammar and word order. It creates a vocabulary of all unique words in the corpus and represents each document as a vector, where each element indicates the frequency of a word in the document. The BoW model is commonly used for text classification tasks and information retrieval systems.

### 3. TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency)
TF-IDF is a numerical statistic that reflects the importance of a word in a document within a collection of documents. It combines the term frequency (TF), which measures how frequently a word appears in a document, and the inverse document frequency (IDF), which penalizes words that are too common across documents. TF-IDF assigns higher weights to words that are important within a document while considering their rarity across the entire corpus.

### 4. N-grams
N-grams are contiguous sequences of n items from a given text, where items can be characters, words, or even larger chunks of text. They are used to capture the context and sequential information in text data. By considering different values of n, such as unigrams (single words), bigrams (pairs of words), trigrams (three-word sequences), and so on, N-grams can provide a more comprehensive representation of text.

## Word2Vec

Word2Vec is a popular algorithm used in natural language processing and machine learning tasks to generate word embeddings. Word embeddings are dense vector representations of words that capture semantic and syntactic relationships between them. They are useful in various text-related applications such as information retrieval, text classification, and language translation.


## Part-of-Speech Tagging
Part-of-Speech (POS) tagging is a fundamental task in Natural Language Processing (NLP), which involves assigning grammatical information (such as noun, verb, adjective, etc.) to each word in a given text. POS tagging plays a crucial role in various NLP applications, including machine translation, sentiment analysis, information retrieval, and more.
